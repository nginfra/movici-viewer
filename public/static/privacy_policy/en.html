  <p class="title is-5">Registering on the MoViCI SaaS platform</p>
  <p>
    If and when you have acquired user access rights for one of our online (SaaS) services
    (Movici Platform) you will be able to register the number of users
    specified by your contract. Your system administrator can enter the intended usersâ€™ email
    addresses and invite them to create a login account. Users will be asked to supply the
    following information:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>First name, family name</li>
    <li>Organization</li>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>IP address of the device that is used for login</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The IP address is only stored for the duration of a user session login and is used to make
    sure that the account is single sign on. The remaining information is used to verify
    access and user rights and will be stored for the duration of the service contract.
  </p>

  <p class="title is-5">Security</p>

    Protection of your data is not possible without security measures. We therefore try to
    maintain a high level of security, by making sure our software is up to date, by providing
    an encrypted version of the website only (using https and security headers), and by
    carefully choosing content. However, sometimes mistakes can be made. Have you found one?
